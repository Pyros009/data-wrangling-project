# Project-3

Intro:
Covid-19 pandemic-related measures forced people into confinement while also removing the ability for people to socialize.
Games were then one of the solutions to hang-out with friends while world was within walls.

Hypothesis: 
Game peak and average attendancies rised during the Covid (so from Dec'19 to Mar'22) then decreased as socialization was normalized.
